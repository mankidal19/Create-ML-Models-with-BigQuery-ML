# Question: How many trips did Yellow taxis take each month in 2015?

```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(pickup_datetime,
    MONTH) month,
  COUNT(*) trips

# Question: What was the average speed of Yellow taxi trips in 2015?

```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR
  FROM
    pickup_datetime) hour,
  ROUND(AVG(trip_distance / TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime,
        pickup_datetime,
        SECOND))*3600, 1) speed
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`

  AND 10
  AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
GROUP BY

```

During the day, the average speed is around 11-12 MPH; but at 5:00 AM the average speed almost doubles to 21 MPH. Intuitively this makes sense since there is likely less traffic on the road at 5:00 AM.

# Predict the price of a cab ride in New York City given the historical dataset of trips and trip data
Predicting the fare before the ride could be very useful for trip planning for both the rider and the taxi agency.

## Create a model based on these features:
- Tolls Amount
- Fare Amount
- Hour of Day
- Pick up address
- Drop off address
- Number of passengers

## Create a training dataset:
```
#standardSQL
WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```

Note a few things about the query:

- The main part of the query is at the bottom (SELECT * from taxitrips).
- taxitrips does the bulk of the extraction for the NYC dataset, with - the SELECT containing your training features and label.
- The WHERE removes data that you don't want to train on.
- The WHERE also includes a sampling clause to pick up only 1/1000th of the data.
- Define a variable called TRAIN so that you can quickly build an independent EVAL set.

## Create a BigQuery ML model

```
CREATE or REPLACE MODEL taxi.taxifare_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['total_fare']) AS

WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```

## Evaluate classification model performance

### Select your performance criteria
For linear regression models you want to use a loss metric like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). You want to keep training and improving the model until it has the lowest RMSE.

In BQML, mean_squared_error is a queryable field when evaluating your trained ML model. Add a SQRT() to get RMSE.

```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model,
  (

  WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

  ))
```

After evaluating your model you get a RMSE of 9.47. Since we took the Root of the Mean Squared Error (RMSE) the 9.47 error can be evaluated in the same units as the total_fare so it's +-$9.47.

Knowing whether or not this loss metric is acceptable to productionalize your model is entirely dependent on your benchmark criteria, which is set before model training begins. Benchmarking is establishing a minimum level of model performance and accuracy that is acceptable.

## Predict taxi fare amount
```
#standardSQL
SELECT
*
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `taxi.taxifare_model`,
   (

 WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

));
```

## Improving the model with Feature Engineering

### Filtering the training dataset

Limit the data to only fares between $$6 and $$200 to avoid learning on strange outliers.

```
SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
# 843,834,902 fares
```

Limit the distance traveled so you're really focusing on New York City.

```
SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    # 827,365,869 fares
```

## Retraining the model

    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2) + POW(( pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as dist, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2)) as longitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in longitude
    SQRT(POW((pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as latitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in latitude
    passenger_count AS passengers

    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```

## Evaluate the new model

```
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model_2,
  (

  WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2) + POW(( pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as dist, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2)) as longitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in longitude
    SQRT(POW((pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as latitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in latitude
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

  ))
```

As you see, you've gotten the RMSE down to: +-$$5.12 which is significantly better than +-$$9.47 for your first model.

Since RMSE defines the standard deviation of prediction errors, we see that the retrained linear regression made our model a lot more accurate.
