## Question: Out of the total visitors who visited our website, what % made a purchase?

```
#standardSQL
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),

purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers
```

## Question: What are the top 5 selling products?

```
SELECT
  p.v2ProductName,
  p.v2ProductCategory,
  SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(h.product) AS p
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Question: How many visitors bought on subsequent visits to the website?

```
# visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
```

# Select features and create your training dataset

Create a machine learning model understand the relationship between data about a visitor's first time on your website and whether they will return and make a purchase.

Firstly, try using these 2 fields:
- totals.bounces (whether the visitor left the website immediately)
- totals.timeOnSite (how long the visitor was on our website)

## Question: What are the risks of only using the above two fields?
Answer: Machine learning is only as good as the training data that is fed into it. If there isn't enough information for the model to determine and learn the relationship between your input features and your label (in this case, whether the visitor bought in the future) then you will not have an accurate model. While training a model on just these two fields is a start, you will see if they're good enough to produce an accurate model.

```
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1)
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Question: Looking at the initial data results, do you think time_on_site and bounces will be a good indicator of whether the user will return and purchase or not?

Answer: It's often too early to tell before training and evaluating the model, but at first glance out of the top 10 time_on_site, only 1 customer returned to buy, which isn't very promising. Let's see how well the model does.

# Select a BigQuery ML model type and specify options

| Model  | Model Type | Label Data type | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Forecasting  | linear_reg | Numeric value (typically an integer or floating point) | Forecast sales figures for next year given historical sales data. | 
| Classification | logistic_reg | 0 or 1 for binary classification | Classify an email as spam or not spam given the context. |

Note: There are many additional model types used in Machine Learning (like Neural Networks and decision trees) and available using libraries like TensorFlow. At the time of writing, BigQuery ML supports the two listed above.

## Train your model:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;
```

Note: You cannot feed all of your available data to the model during training since you need to save some unseen data points for model evaluation and testing. To accomplish this, add a WHERE clause condition is being used to filter and train on only the first 9 months of session data in your 12 month dataset.

# Improve model performance with Feature Engineering

Add more fields:
- How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit
- Where the visitor came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc..)
- Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Geographic information (country)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`

  (model_type='logistic_reg', labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']) AS

)

# add in new features

     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430' # train 9 months

  GROUP BY

  bounces,
  time_on_site,

);
```

Note: You are still training on the same first 9 months of data, even with this new model. It's important to have the same training dataset so you can be certain a better model output is attributable to better input features and not new or different training data.

```

## Results
Of the top 6% of first-time visitors (sorted in decreasing order of predicted probability), more than 6% make a purchase in a later visit.
These users represent nearly 50% of all first-time visitors who make a purchase in a later visit.
Overall, only 0.7% of first-time visitors make a purchase in a later visit.
Targeting the top 6% of first-time increases marketing ROI by 9x vs targeting them all!


# Additional information
Tip: add warm_start = true to your model options if you are retraining new data on an existing model for faster training times. Note that you cannot change the feature columns (this would necessitate a new model).

roc_auc is just one of the performance metrics available during model evaluation. Also available are accuracy, precision, and recall. Knowing which performance metric to rely on is highly dependent on what your overall objective or goal is.
